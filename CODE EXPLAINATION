Iris Dataset Random Forest Classifier
This project demonstrates how to load the Iris dataset, train a Random Forest classifier model, and evaluate its performance using Python's scikit-learn library. The project also visualizes the feature importance and confusion matrix to understand the model's performance better.

Steps:
Install Necessary Libraries:

We begin by installing and updating the required libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib.

Load the Iris Dataset:

The Iris dataset is a popular dataset that contains information about the sepal and petal length and width of three species of Iris flowers. It is used for classification tasks.

The dataset is loaded using load_iris() from sklearn.datasets, which returns both the features and the target values.

Preprocessing the Data:

The data is converted into a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.

The target column (the species of the flowers) is separated from the feature columns (sepal length, sepal width, etc.).

Split the Data:

The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split(). 80% of the data is used for training, and 20% is used for testing the model.

Train a Random Forest Classifier:

A Random Forest model is created using RandomForestClassifier() from sklearn.ensemble.

The model is trained on the training data using the fit() method.

Make Predictions:

After training, predictions are made on the test data using the predict() method.

Evaluate the Model:

The model's accuracy is calculated by comparing the predicted values to the actual values using accuracy_score().

The accuracy is printed as a percentage.

Visualizing Feature Importance:

The importance of each feature in making predictions is extracted from the trained model.

A horizontal bar chart is plotted to show which features are the most influential in determining the classification of Iris flowers.

Confusion Matrix:

A confusion matrix is displayed to visualize how well the model classified each of the three Iris species.

The confusion matrix is plotted using a heatmap from the seaborn library.

Technologies Used:
scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms and tools.

pandas for data manipulation and handling.

matplotlib for plotting graphs.

seaborn for advanced visualization (confusion matrix heatmap).

Code Explanation:
The provided Python code loads the Iris dataset, splits it into training and testing sets, trains a Random Forest classifier, and evaluates the model's accuracy. It also visualizes the feature importance and confusion matrix for better understanding of the model's behavior.
